<h3>Graph Builder</h3>


<p class="Paranum" style="">Graphs can be created
    visually with the Graph Builder,&nbsp;processed&nbsp;directly from
    the DAT and then saved as XML files. &nbsp;These saved graphs can then
    also be used as the input for the command line Graph Processing Tool
    (GPT) with a different set
    of input data products.</p>

<p class="Paranum" style="">The Graph Builder&nbsp;allows the user to assemble graphs from a list of
    available operators and connect operator nodes to their sources<br>

</p>

    <br>


    <p class="Paranum">Right click on the top panel to add an Operator. As Operators are added, their
        corresponding OperatorUIs are created and added as tabs to a property sheet.
        &nbsp;The OperatorUIs&nbsp;accept user input
        for the Operator&#8217;s parameters.</p>

    <p class="Paranum">Connect Operator graph nodes by moving the mouse
        over the left edge of an Operator node until a circle appears. Then
        drag the mouse over the Operator node you wish to designate as the
        source. Every node except for a Reader node will require a source.</p>

    <p class="Paranum">Before saving or processing a graph, the Graph
        Builder calls each operator to validate its parameters.
        &nbsp;Validation&nbsp;also occurs at the graph level to ensure
        there are no cycles and that each operator has the appropriate
        connections.</p>
